## Extracting review data from dslreports.com

In this project, we used [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) to extract review data of the ISP Bell Canada from [dslreports.com](https://www.dslreports.com/) and save it to a csv file.

This will later be extended to include:

1. Extracting review data of other Canadian ISPs.
2. Visualizing and analysing review data.
